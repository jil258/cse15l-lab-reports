# Lab Report 3

## Part1 List Methods
### A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
```
List<String> inputList = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "cherry");
List<String> filteredList = ListExamples.filter(inputList, sc);
        List<String> expectedList = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana");
        assertEquals(expectedList, filteredList);

testFilter(ListTests)
java.lang.AssertionError: expected:<[apple, banana]> but was:<[banana, apple]>
        at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:89)
        at org.junit.Assert.failNotEquals(Assert.java:835)
        at org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:120)
        at org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:146)
        at ListTests.testFilter(ListTests.java:20)
```

### An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
```
List<String> inputList2 = Arrays.asList();
        List<String> filteredList2 = ListExamples.filter(inputList2, sc);
        List<String> expectedList2 = Arrays.asList();
        assertEquals(expectedList2, filteredList2);

JUnit version 4.13.2
.
Time: 0.003

OK (1 test)
```


### The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)

The filter is intended to returns a new list that has all the elements of the input list for which the StringChecker returns true, and not the elements that return false, in
**the same order they appeared in the input list**. However the actual functionality do the StringChecker and add to the list in **Reverse order**.

The code produce expected output on a empty list and on a list with single element but can failed on a longer lists.

### The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown)

The fix made the adding to the end of the list instead of pushing from the front.
```
// Before:
static List<String> filter(List<String> list, StringChecker sc) {
    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    for(String s: list) {
      if(sc.checkString(s)) {
        result.add(0, s);
      }
    }
    return result;
  }

// After:
static List<String> filter(List<String> list, StringChecker sc) {
    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    for(String s: list) {
      if(sc.checkString(s)) {
        result.add(s);
      }
    }
    return result;
  }
```

## Part 2 - Researching Commands

grep command is what I choose since it is powerful when searching text using patterns. I have discover the below example through online search and combining the command on the used of the file in that we used in this week's lab.

#### Option 1: -i (Ignore case)
The -i option allows grep to perform case-insensitive searches. It's useful when the case of the text is unknown or it is a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters.

Example 1: Search for the word "network" regardless of case
bash
Copy code
grep -i "network" ./technical/config.txt
This command will find all occurrences of the word "network" in the file config.txt within the ./technical directory, ignoring whether it is typed as "Network", "NETWORK", or any other case variation.

Example 2: Search for the word "error" in all .log files
bash
Copy code
grep -i "error" ./technical/*.log
This searches for the word "error" in all .log files under the ./technical directory, ignoring case.

#### Option 2: -r (Recursive)
The -r option allows grep to search recursively through directories, which means it will also search through all the subdirectories and their files.

Example 1: Recursively search for "admin" in all files
bash
Copy code
grep -r "admin" ./technical/
This command searches for the string "admin" in all files within the ./technical directory and its subdirectories.

Example 2: Recursively search for "timeout" in .conf files
bash
Copy code
grep -r "timeout" ./technical/*.conf
Even though the *.conf pattern is used, with the -r flag, grep will search for "timeout" in all .conf files in the directory and subdirectories.

#### Option 3: -v (Invert match)
The -v option inverts the match, showing only the lines that do not match the given pattern. It's useful when you want to exclude certain lines.

Example 1: Show lines that do not contain "success"
bash
Copy code
grep -v "success" ./technical/results-summary.txt
This command will output all lines from the file results-summary.txt that do not contain the word "success".

Example 2: Exclude lines with "deprecated" from search results
bash
Copy code
grep -v "deprecated" ./technical/upgrade-notes.md
This command filters out lines containing the term "deprecated" from the file upgrade-notes.md.

#### Option 4: --color (Color match)
The --color option highlights the matching text. This can be extremely useful when you want to visually locate the matches quickly.

Example 1: Color-highlight "fail" in output
bash
Copy code
grep --color "fail" ./technical/error_report.txt
This will display the error_report.txt file's contents with the term "fail" highlighted in color.

Example 2: Highlight "critical" in red for visibility
bash
Copy code
grep --color "critical" ./technical/system_logs/*
This searches through all files within the system_logs directory for the word "critical" and highlights it in the output.

These options were found using the man grep command on a Linux system, which displays the manual pages for commands. Additionally, online resources such as Linux manual pages online and various Linux forums provide detailed explanations of these options.

Please note that the actual output from the commands isn't shown here, as these examples are hypothetical and I don't have access to your ./technical directory or its contents. If you have a specific directory or files you want to test these commands on, and they are accessible to me, I can run the commands and show you the actual output.
